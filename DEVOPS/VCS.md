- A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps **track and manage changes to files over time**
- It's like a **“time machine” for your code or documents** — it keeps a history of all changes and lets you go back to any version, compare them, or even undo mistakes.
- ## Why It's Useful

- ✅ **Keeps history**: You can go back to an earlier version of a file.
    
- 👥 **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
    
- 🔍 **Tracking**: See what changed, who changed it, and when.
    
- 🚨 **Mistake recovery**: If something breaks, you can revert to a working version.
